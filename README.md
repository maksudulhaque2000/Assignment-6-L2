## üèóÔ∏è Architecture & Key Decisions

-   **State Management:** **Redux Toolkit** with **RTK Query** was chosen for centralized state management and efficient API data caching. This simplifies API calls, handles loading/error states automatically, and provides features like `providesTags` and `invalidatesTags` for seamless data re-fetching after mutations.
-   **Project Structure:** The project follows a feature-sliced architecture. Code is organized by features (e.g., `auth`, `admin`, `ride`) inside the `src/redux/features` directory, and by type (e.g., `pages`, `components`, `layouts`) for UI, promoting scalability and maintainability.
-   **Styling:** **Tailwind CSS (v4)** with its Vite plugin provides a utility-first approach for rapid and consistent UI development. Dark mode is implemented using Tailwind's `dark` variant strategy.
-   **Persistent Login:** A `PersistLogin` component leverages `localStorage` to retrieve the user's token on page load. It then triggers an API call to `/auth/me` to verify the token and fetch the latest user data, ensuring the session is both persistent and secure.
